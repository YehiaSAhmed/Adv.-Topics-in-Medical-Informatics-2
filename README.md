# Adv. Topics in Medical Informatics 2

This repository was made for the required tasks in the **Advanced Topics in Medical Informatics 2** course, which was *Elective 6* in Spring A.Y. 2023/2024.

## *Syllabus*

* **Tentative Topics**:
    * Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Dimensionality Reduction
    * Data Tours
    * Finding Clusters
    * Graphical Methods for EDA
    * Visualizing Clusters
    * Distribution Shapes
    * Multivariate Visualization
    * Visualizing Categorical Data

### Assignments:

Assignment # | Requirements
| --- | --- |
1 | Perform data whitening (sphering) on a generated 2D normally distributed dataset, implement PCA on the IRIS dataset, and complete Exercise 2.1 from Exploratory Data Analysis Using MATLAB using Python.
2 | Implement Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on the IRIS dataset and reduce its dimensionality to one dimension and then to two dimensions for comparative analysis.
3 | Develop a self-organizing map (SOM) from scratch, apply it to the breast cancer dataset after data cleaning and normalization, and visualize the trained map (*Note: I don't remember where the deliverable file that I submitted is because I delivered it on Google Classroom*).
4 | Implement agglomerative hierarchical clustering from scratch and apply it to the IRIS dataset using both single-link and Ward’s methods, comparing the approaches in terms of cluster structure and sensitivity to outliers.
